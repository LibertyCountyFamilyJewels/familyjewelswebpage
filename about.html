<h1 style="font-family:'Playfair Display',serif">Our Story</h1>
<p>Founded in 2002 by Cyra Helifax, Family Jewels was born from a vision to create more than just a jewelry store—it was meant to be a place where stories are told, memories are honored, and traditions are carried forward.

Cyra, a lifelong artisan with an eye for timeless beauty, began her journey in a small studio with only a few handcrafted designs and a dream to make fine jewelry accessible without losing its personal touch. She believed that every ring, necklace, and bracelet should not only shine, but also carry meaning—whether it’s a promise, a celebration, or a legacy passed down through generations.

Over the years, Family Jewels has grown into a trusted name, blending classic craftsmanship with modern design. From engagement rings that mark new beginnings to heirloom pieces meant to last lifetimes, every item in our collection is chosen with care and intention.

At Family Jewels, we like to say: “We’re not just a store—we’re family.” Our customers aren’t simply buyers; they’re part of a community built on trust, love, and shared milestones.</p>
