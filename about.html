        <h2>The Start</h2>
        <p>
          The story begins in 1989 with nothing more than a handful of tools and a dream — a dream Cyra Helifax carried since childhood. At just twelve years old, working out of her parents’ garage, she began handcrafting jewelry for friends and family.
        </p>
        <p>
          When her parents went through a difficult separation and her mother struggled to make ends meet, Cyra faced a choice: take a minimum-wage job, or push her craft into something greater. Spoiler alert — she chose the latter. What started as a way to help her family soon took shape as <strong>Family Jewels</strong>, a vision that would grow far beyond the garage where it began.

      <div class="story-text">
        <h2>The Establishment</h2>
        <p>
          After years of late nights in the garage, Cyra had saved and planned enough to think bigger than most her age. Instead of opening just one store, she commissioned the construction of an entire strip mall in Liberty County — a bold move for someone so young.
        </p>
        <p>
          She opened Family Jewels as the anchor tenant, then leased the other units to local businesses. It was a decision that not only gave her store a home but also created opportunity for her community. Customers soon realized they weren’t just shopping at a jewelry store — they were entering a place built on resilience, vision, and a desire to grow together.

      <div class="story-text">
        <h2>The Journey Forward</h2>
        <p>
          From that first strip mall, Family Jewels quickly became a trusted name. Cyra’s eye for design and her courage to take risks shaped the company into more than just a brand — it became a community landmark.
        </p>
        <p>
          With each passing year, she blended classic craftsmanship with modern design, creating pieces that weren’t just beautiful but meaningful. Every ring, every necklace, every heirloom carried the same spirit that drove her as a young girl in that garage: determination, artistry, and love.

      <div class="story-text">
        <h2>The Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          What began in 2001 as a dream in a garage has grown into a legacy. Family Jewels continues to honor its roots by crafting jewelry that celebrates stories, milestones, and traditions. And just like Cyra’s bold choice to build not one store but an entire strip mall, Family Jewels stands as a reminder that dreams are worth chasing — and that sometimes the biggest risks turn into the most enduring rewards.

        <h2>Today & Tomorrow</h2>
        <p>
          Today, Family Jewels is more than a jeweler — it’s a community built on trust, artistry, and the shared stories of countless families. From engagement rings that begin new chapters to heirloom pieces that carry generations of love, every design is made with intention and care.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, that mission continues. With new collections, modern innovations, and the same timeless dedication, Family Jewels looks ahead with the same spirit Cyra carried at twelve years old: the belief that jewelry is never just jewelry — <strong>it’s family, it’s memory, it’s legacy.</strong>
